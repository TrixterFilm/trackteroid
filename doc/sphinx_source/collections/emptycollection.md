The concept of the `EmptyCollection` shares similarities with the [optional type](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/Optional.html) found in various programming languages. It serves as a mechanism to handle the absence of values or empty results.

Similar to optional types in other languages, the `EmptyCollection` provides a consistent interface and allows for operations and attribute access without the need for explicit checks for empty or null values. It acts as a container that represents the absence of a value or result.

By utilizing the `EmptyCollection`, developers can write cleaner and more concise code by treating empty results as a valid state without the need for verbose conditional statements. This promotes a more functional programming style, allowing for seamless chaining and composition of operations even in scenarios where the result might be empty.

Just as optional types in different programming languages offer methods or functions to check for presence (isPresent()) and provide fallback values (orElse()), the `EmptyCollection` provides simple fallback functionality to handle cases where the collection is empty as it always evaluates to `False`.

```python
from trackteroid import (
    Asset,
    Query
)

asset_collection = Query(Asset).by_name("DOESNT_EXIST").get_all()
print(asset_collection)
# output: EmptyCollection[Asset]
```
